aluminum
========

Lightweight, minimal OpenGL framework using C++11. Supports openGL 3.2 on osx/cocoa and linux/freeglut; plan to support openGL ES 2.0 on ios and the raspberry pi as well.

Included required libraries: freeimage, assimp3, glm.

Features: active and anaglyph stereo rendering; signed-distance texts; textured text; high resolution timing/animation methodsi (via C++11's chrono); model loading (via assimp); texture reading/writing (via freeimage); 6DOF vector camera class; etc. 

Originally created to add OpenGL 3.2 & OpenGL ES 2.0 to the allocore framework. Aluminum is an extensible coding framework for the Alloshpere Reserach Facility at UC Santa Barbara.

Linux requires freeglut2.6 (or above?), see readme in linux directory.
