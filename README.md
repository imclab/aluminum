aluminum
========

Lightweight, minimal OpenGL framework. Supports openGL 3.2 on osx/cocoa and linux/freeglut; plan to support openGL ES 2.0 on ios and the raspberry pi as well.

Included required libraries: freeimage, assimp, glm.

Features: active and anaglyph stereo rendering; signed-distance texts; textured text; timing/animation methods; model loading (via assimp); texture reading/writing (via freeimage); 6DOF vector camera class. 

Originally created to add OpenGL 3.2 & OpenGL ES 2.0 to the allocore framework. Aluminum is an extensible coding framework for the Alloshpere Reserach Facility at UC Santa Barbara.
