[1mNAME[0m
     [1mscript[0m -- make typescript of terminal session

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
     [1mscript[0m [[1m-akq[0m] [[1m-t[0m [4mtime[24m] [[4mfile[24m [[4mcommand[24m [4m...[24m]]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     The [1mscript[0m utility makes a typescript of everything printed on your terminal.  It is useful for
     students who need a hardcopy record of an interactive session as proof of an assignment, as the
     typescript file can be printed out later with lpr(1).

     If the argument [4mfile[24m is given, [1mscript[0m saves all dialogue in [4mfile[24m.  If no file name is given, the
     typescript is saved in the file [4mtypescript[24m.

     If the argument [4mcommand[24m is given, [1mscript[0m will run the specified command with an optional argument
     vector instead of an interactive shell.

     The following options are available:

     [1m-a[0m      Append the output to [4mfile[24m or [4mtypescript[24m, retaining the prior contents.

     [1m-k[0m      Log keys sent to program as well as output.

     [1m-q[0m      Run in quiet mode, omit the start and stop status messages.

     [1m-t[0m [4mtime[24m
             Specify time interval between flushing script output file.  A value of 0 causes [1mscript[0m to
             flush for every character I/O event.  The default interval is 30 seconds.

     The script ends when the forked shell (or command) exits (a [4mcontrol-D[24m to exit the Bourne shell
     (sh(1)), and [4mexit[24m, [4mlogout[24m or [4mcontrol-D[24m (if [4mignoreeof[24m is not set) for the C-shell, csh(1)).
